# Belly_Button_Beef
Mod 12

Through this assignment a bar graph, gauge, and bubble chart were created as visualizations to better understand the belly button data. Early in the work a drop down was set up so that individual subjects can be selected, then the subject's demographics along with the respective charts can be viewed. 

Below is a screenshot of the webpage, however it is not the final. An image was added to span the page to break up the visuals.
